## Your Turn: Discuss

In groups of 2-3 people, discuss

### **What is your research about?**

  - What part of your research would you like to visualise?
  - What plots would you use?
  - What parts would you make interactive?

### **What ways might you change the current apps?**

  - Can you think of different ways to visualise the data?
